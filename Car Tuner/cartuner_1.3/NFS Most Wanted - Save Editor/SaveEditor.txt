Need For Speed Most Wanted Save Editor
--------------------------------------

Using this small program you can change the amount of money
and bounty for the first car in your garage during the career
play. Besides, you can rename your alias what means that the
prog will rename the corresponding directory and file, then 
it will replace alias occurrences in the savefile with the
text entered. This feature can be useful because it is not
implemented in the game itself, so the only way to do that is
to create a new profile/alias and replay the game from the
beginning.

The save file is changed directly, but there is no need to
quit the game, 'cause it caches your current profile in memory
during play. Thus the only thing you have to do is to reload the
modified profile in the game.

At startup the program will initialize in the default savegame
folder (My Documents\NFS Most Wanted) for the logged on user.
But you can select a different folder using the "Browse" button
or re-read current by pressing the "Update" button.

This program is distributed "AS IS" what means that the author
is not responsible for any damage to your savefiles or any other
case of misoperation due to the (probably wrong) usage of that
program. So, make a backup copy of your savegames.

Please, refer to the techinfo.txt if you are interested in some
technical details.

Have fun!
